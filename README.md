# CS4303 Practical 3: Robotron 4303

The specification outlined the creation of a variant of the classic video game Robotron 2084 through use of the Processing language. The final implementation includes the variations specified, including the use of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) to generate random levels and power ups available for the player to collect. In addition to this, the variant extends upon the specification through the inclusion of an upgrade shop, starting options menu and several player weapons. Furthermore, the code builds on top of an extensive class inheritance system started in the previous practical.
